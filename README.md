# 🎨 Colorization of Grayscale Images Using Conditional GANs (cGANs)

Welcome to this image colorization project, where grayscale images get their groove back! Using the power of **Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs)**, this project breathes color into black-and-white photos — turning monotone pixels into vibrant visuals 🌈

## 📌 Project Overview

> “Color is a power which directly influences the soul.” — Wassily Kandinsky  
This project explores **automatic colorization** of grayscale images using a deep learning model trained on a **small custom dataset**. It leverages the adversarial magic of GANs to generate RGB images from grayscale inputs — sharper and more vivid than traditional pixel-wise techniques.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To develop a Conditional GAN that colorizes grayscale images into realistic RGB outputs using a high-resolution, visually diverse dataset — without relying on pre-trained networks.

## 🔍 Model Architecture

### 🎨 Generator (U-Net)
- Converts grayscale image (1 channel) → color image (3 channels)
- Uses skip connections to preserve spatial info

### 🔎 Discriminator (PatchGAN)
- Sees input as a pair (gray + color)
- Trains to tell real from fake colorization

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Load 10 high-res images
2. Convert them to grayscale
3. Resize to 64x64 and normalize to [-1, 1]
4. Train using:
   - Binary Cross Entropy (GAN loss)
   - L1 loss (pixel-wise similarity)
5. Visualize outputs after each epoch
6. Save final model weights
